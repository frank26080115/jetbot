The firmware for the actual Jetson Nano is not here, since all that code is a fork of the Nvidia official Jetbot github repo

The contents of this directory is an Arduino sketchbook meant for the Teensy firmware that emulates the Adafruit PWM driver

This allows me to use much more powerful motor drivers, and extended it to add ADC capabilities and other features

M1 = RIGHT MOTOR
PWM 8 = Right Motor ENABLE
PWM 9 = Right Motor IN2
PWM 10 = Right Motor IN1

M2 = LEFT MOTOR
PWM 13 = Left Motor ENABLE
PWM 12 = Left Motor IN2
PWM 11 = Left Motor IN1

PWM 7 = M4 ENABLE
PWM 6 = M4 IN2
PWM 5 = M4 IN1

PWM 2 = M3 ENABLE
PWM 3 = M3 IN2
PWM 4 = M3 IN1
